# Gradient Descent

A Python implementation and interactive exploration of the Gradient Descent optimization algorithm. This repository demonstrates gradient descent on various cost functions and provides utilities for visualizing its convergence behavior.

## Features

- **Core Algorithm**: Simple, educational implementation of gradient descent for univariate and multivariate functions.
- **Visualization**: Plots showing the path of gradient descent on different loss landscapes.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend for new functions, learning rates, and stopping criteria.
- **Jupyter Notebook Support**: Interactive notebooks for experimenting with parameters and observing results in real time.

## Getting Started

- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) (optional, for notebooks)

Install requirements:
